## App Brainstorming
### X/ Twitter
- Hearing all the latest news by following main and fan accounts.
- Discussions are easily started within discussions
- Grok AI tool seems promisiing.
### Reddit
- Finding about products from other users
- Can learn about any topic and ask direct questions to each community
- Lean something new from posts recommended by the algorithm
### Youtube
- I love passing time watching video content
- Can learn something useful from others following a guide
- Having the ability to go back and see my view history to rewatch or finish a video
### App Idea
A creative makers app that includes real time updates for personal projects asked by a client to the creator. The initial setup for this app is crud like in nature but requires the creator to give feedback to the client without seeming excessively pushy or interrupting the work flow. Clients request updates, creators respond with images, descriptions, and ETAs. AI implementation could be added later to include dynamic estimates for completion based on previous orders for specific creation. Later on include a dynamic AI generative idea maker for clients to have other ideas to incorporate into their custom creation. For example, a client has a ruby princess cut stone and wants to create a men's ring with a ribbed shank. The AI can produce images for the creation and help the creator with inspiration. In a way, this is kind of abstracting the client creator relationship to be more streamlined without adding direct conversation. 
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
